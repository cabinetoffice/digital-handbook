Welcome to the CO Digital Handbook, your comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing digital the Cabinet Office way through out set of policies, standards, principles, strategies, guidance, and blueprints that we frequently use to ensure our technology is compliance to regulations, policies and follow the industrial and government best practice.

This handbook serves as the foundation of our digital transformation efforts, ensuring that we approach our digital initiatives with clarity, consistency, and a shared vision.

## Purpose
The CO Digital Handbook is designed to:

* Provide clear and actionable guidance on our digital practices.
* Ensure consistency and alignment across all digital projects.
* Foster a culture of transparency, innovation, and inclusivity.
* Support our mission to deliver efficient, effective, and user-centric digital services.

The CO Digital Handbook embodies our commitment to excellence and our dedication to providing good digital services to the Cabinet Office.

Letâ€™s embrace digital transformation together!

## Type of Governance Artefacts

| Artefact | Definition | Purpose | Adherence |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |-------- |
| Principle | A fundamental proposition serving as the foundation for the design of an architecture. | To ensure that the architecture aligns with the organisation's goals, strategies, and standards, and inform the development of policies and standards. | Advisory |
| Regulation | A rule or directive made and maintained by an authority.|To ensure compliance with laws, protect public welfare, maintain standards, and ensure fairness.| Mandatory within specified scope|
| Policy | A formal binding directive outlining intentions and direction of an organisation.|To provide a framework for decision-making and establish overall principles and guidelines to follow.|Mandatory within specified scope|
| Standard | Specific, detailed rules that must be followed to comply with a policy. | To ensure consistency and quality across various processes and activities within an organisation. | Mandatory within specified scope|
| Strategy | A plan of action designed to achieve a specific goal or set of goals. | To provide clear direction and actionable steps to reach desired outcomes, guide decision-making, and align efforts. | Mandatory within specified scope|
| Guidance | Advice, recommendations, or best practices to aid implementation. | To support the application of policies and standards, clarify expectations, and provide practical instructions. | Recommended |
| Blueprint & patterns | Comprehensive documents or diagrams outlining the architecture of digital systems. | To provide a clear and structured framework for building and managing digital systems, ensuring alignment with business objectives and technical requirements. | Recommended |


When applying the above governance artefacts, it is crucial to understand their applicable scope. For instance, government service standards primarily pertain to bespoke digital services and do not fully extend to purchased technologies.

# <%%= current_page.data.title %>

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing a standard about is important.

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

## Principles

Principles are fundamental truths or propositions serving as the foundation for a system.  They are used to shape the values and culture of an organisation and inform the development of policies and standards. Principles are advisory in nature.

## Architecture

The "Architecture" section of this Digital Handbook is designed to provide the guiding principles that underpin architecture, reference architecture and blueprints we use for architectural designs. 

The technical blueprints provide an overview of the Cabinet Office technology landscape, providing a starting point for when we want to introduce new technology into the Cabinet Office. 

The purpose of our reference architecture is to offer a consistent framework, detailed schematics and specifications that supports the development and deployment of digital solutions across the organisation. 

By adhering to established architecture principles, we aim to encourage the reuse of proven solutions, foster the consolidation of resources, and enhance interoperability and scalability. 

This approach not only streamlines processes and reduces redundancy but also ensures that our digital initiatives are aligned with our strategic goals and can adapt to evolving technological landscapes. 

Through this guidance, we aspire to create a cohesive and resilient digital infrastructure that supports innovation and operational excellence.

| Term                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tech Blueprint (Enterprise Solution) | An enterprise-wide blueprint, presenting the centralized, approved technology and tools used in different domains. Most of these technologies have centralized contracts and a service support wrapper to ensure resilience. |
| Reference Architecture   | A template solution for an architecture for a particular domain. It contains a common vocabulary and structure for implementations, helping streamline processes, improve interoperability, and ensure consistency across projects.      |
| Design Patterns          | General, reusable solutions to common problems or challenges in software design. They provide a template for solving a problem in a specific context, promoting best practices and ensuring consistency in code. Examples: Integration pattern, Model-View-Controller (MVC). |
