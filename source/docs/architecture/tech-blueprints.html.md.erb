### Tech Blueprints (Enterprise Solutions)

**Tech Blueprints (Enterprise Solution)** is a logical model showing how functional areas are enabled by relevant vendor platforms and products.  

As a visual representation, it helps clarify the organisation’s technology portfolio and enables better decision-making to simplify the technology estate.


### Advantages of a Technology Blueprint

- **Easier Access to DDaT Offerings**:  
  A clear and articulate digital front door is required for business, including functions and civil servants, to easily access service offerings.

- **Alignment of Platforms & Contracts**:  
  Leverage the foundation set within CO Digital’s AWS consolidation to reduce duplication, harness full software capability, and centralise digital spend insight.

- **Central Focus for Digital Innovation**:  
  Empower teams, including forming a delivery engine to provide scalable digital products, e.g., AI.

- **Improved Architectural Design**:  
  An approach and mechanism to manage legacy, develop interoperability, and architectural coherence, including clear patterns, standards, and policies.


### Future State Technology Principles

The principles for how the future state technology model will operate are set out below. They will enable compliance by design with **Functional Standard GovS005; Digital**, as well as an assessment of the future state CO Digital Technology blueprint against these principles.

**1. Aligned Strategy & Standards**
- The technology estate aligns with the CO Digital Strategy, roadmap, and also the Government Standards, e.g., **GovS005; Digital**, Technology Code of Practice, and other relevant standards.
- The Cabinet Office Future State Technology Blueprint is based on Falcon’s corporate solution.

**2. Identify Efficiency Opportunities**
- The technology model will identify areas of technology duplication, including contracts and gaps within the landscape, to drive cost efficiency and effectiveness.
- Consider the total cost of ownership of a product or service over its entire lifecycle (design, build, operation, and maintenance) to optimise value and minimise costs.

**3. Reduce Technology Risks**
- The technology estate will be continuously optimised to ensure it possesses the necessary capabilities and skills to meet the evolving needs of the business, while improving efficiency, scalability, and security.
- Utilise the existing Legacy Technology Strategy to help define, profile, assess risk, and prioritise, ultimately producing treatment plans introduced in a legacy management plan across the estate.

**4. Leverage Existing Technology**
- If something works, use it again. Adding or replacing successful technologies can cause frustration and hinder adoption.
- **Buy vs Build**: Evaluate whether to purchase an existing solution or build a custom solution in-house, based on factors like cost, time-to-market, scalability, and strategic alignment with goals.

**5. Interoperable & Secure**
- Digital and technology components are designed using mandatory government open standards where needed. They are secure, adaptable, interoperable, and shareable.
