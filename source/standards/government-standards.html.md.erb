Government standards are essential guidelines that ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency across various public sector operations and services. These standards provide a unified framework that agencies and departments can follow, promoting best practices and ensuring that services are delivered effectively and reliably.


## [Technical Code of practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice)

The Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) is a cross-government agreed standard used for the Cabinet Office spend control process and the Local Digital Declaration.

You should use the TCoP for all of your technology projects or programmes. Consider each point, align your project or programme with the mandatory points, and follow as many of the remaining points as is practical. You’ll get the most benefit by aligning your organisation’s technology and business strategies to the Technology Code of Practice.

Each point contains guidance and links to case studies to help you migrate from legacy infrastructure and manage the full lifecycle of your technology.

## [Service Standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)
The Service Standard helps teams to create and run great public services.  Service standards should be applied when creating and running public services. They can be applied in different contexts, such as when building a website or calculator, or when creating a service for government employees.

You can [check if you need to meet the service standards or get an assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard). There are [guidance on how to apply the service standards](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-to-apply-the-service-standard).

## [API technical and data standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards)
These standards are for people building Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in government who want to:
* save time and resources
* assure users that their service meets minimum standards
* use agile methods to improve products and services
* use the REST API style
* take an API-first approach to development

You should use these standards when designing, building and operating your APIs for use in government and public services. This will ensure that your APIs work better across different platforms and services.
