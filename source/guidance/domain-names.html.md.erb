The Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) has published comprehensive domain name guidance to help public sector organisations manage and secure their digital identities effectively. This guidance provides a step-by-step approach to applying for, using, and maintaining a .gov.uk domain name, ensuring that these critical digital assets are protected and used appropriately.

By following this guidance, government agencies can ensure their domain names are secure, up-to-date, and aligned with best practices, thereby maintaining the trust and confidence of citizens in public sector services.

The "Apply for a .gov.uk Domain Name: Step-by-Step Guidance" provides a detailed process for public sector organisations to obtain a .gov.uk domain name. The steps include checking eligibility, identifying a registrant, choosing a domain name, submitting an application through an approved registrar, and managing the domain once approved1. The guidance also covers protecting the domain, following usage rules, and keeping contact details up to date to ensure security and compliance.

### [Get a non-government domain name](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-a-non-government-domain-name)

The "Get a Non-Government Domain Name" guidance explains how public sector organisations can apply for a non-government domain name, such as .co.uk, .org.uk, or .com, if they qualify for an exemption or need to defensively register a domain to protect against spoofing. It outlines the eligibility criteria, the process for choosing and buying a domain name, and the responsibilities of managing it, including appointing a trusted domain name administrator.
