# Architecture

The "Architecture" section of this Digital Handbook is designed to provide the guiding principles that underpin architecture, reference architecture and blueprints we use for architectural designs.

The technical blueprints provide an overview of the Cabinet Office technology landscape, providing a starting point for when we want to introduce new technology into the Cabinet Office.

The purpose of our reference architecture is to offer a consistent framework, detailed schematics and specifications that supports the development and deployment of digital solutions across the organisation.

By adhering to established architecture principles, we aim to encourage the reuse of proven solutions, foster the consolidation of resources, and enhance interoperability and scalability.

This approach not only streamlines processes and reduces redundancy but also ensures that our digital initiatives are aligned with our strategic goals and can adapt to evolving technological landscapes.

Through this guidance, we aspire to create a cohesive and resilient digital infrastructure that supports innovation and operational excellence.


## Architecture Roles and Responsibilities

The Cabinet Office follows the [Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/) in defining architecture capabilities and responsibilities. This framework defines the different architecture roles as follow:

* [Business architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/business-architect)
* [Data architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/data-architect)
* [Enterprise architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/enterprise-architect)
* [Network architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/network-architect)
* [Security architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/security-architect)
* [Solution architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/solution-architect)
* [Technical architect](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/technical-architect)
