The Cabinet Office Architecture Principles are a set of rules and guidelines that apply across the Cabinet Office. They exist to help projects and programmes realise the wider
technology-related objectives for the Cabinet Office, and hence enable and support the CO business goals. They should be used to guide project decision-making within relevant teams.

The purpose of these Architecture Principles is to consider the Cabinet Office as a whole, functioning business-value delivering Enterprise. Delivery activities represent the discrete step changes, both adding to and removing from the operational technology environment that we operate in Cabinet Office.

You should use these principles in conjunction with the other related Cabinet Office principles, policies and strategies in the areas of concern.  These include the Service Acceptance Principles and the Cabinet Office Hosting Principles and Strategies, Data Strategies and Technology Strategies which provide a more focused and detailed set of implementation guidance and governance for specific technology subsets or domains.

These principles are in alignment with the Technology Code of Practice, Government Design Principles, GOV.UK Service Manual, NCSC Cloud Security Principle and Cloud First Policy. They are intended to consider the Government-wide content and apply them to the context of the Cabinet Office.

## Using These principles

These architecture principles are general rules and guidelines and reflect a level of consensus across the enterprise and embody the spirit and thinking of those within and working with the enterprise architecture function.

The principles inform and represent the approach for digital and technology activities within the Cabinet Office such that the immediate project needs can be aligned with the longer-term vision and sustainable operations for the wider Cabinet Office. They reflect a level of consensus across the enterprise and embody the spirit and thinking of those within and working with the enterprise architecture function.

As part of technology seeking technology input, reviews, and assurance processes, we expect projects and programmes to be able to relate their plans and activities to these principles, and capture that knowledge for sharing across Cabinet Office.
