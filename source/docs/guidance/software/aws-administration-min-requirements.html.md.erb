# <%= current_page.data.title %>


AWS administrators in the Cabinet Office hold a critical responsibility for the security, compliance, and efficient operation of organisational cloud infrastructure. Granting administrative access to untrained personnel introduces significant risks across cybersecurity, data protection, compliance, and financial domains. To mitigate these risks, strict requirements and responsibilities are established.
<br>

## Risks of Inadequate Access Management

#### Cybersecurity Risks

* Increased vulnerability to cyber threats due to misconfigured security settings.  
* Susceptibility to unauthorised access, privilege escalation, or misuse from over-privileged permissions.  
* Potential exploitation by malicious actors or accidental mishandling.

#### Data Breach Risks

* Greater chance of unintentional data exposure or deletion caused by excessive access rights.  
* Risk of unauthorised data access due to improper permission controls.  
* Possible data leaks or loss impacting organisational confidentiality and compliance.

#### Compliance Risks

* Non-compliance with standards such as GDPR, Cyber Essentials, and other regulations due to overly broad permissions.  
* Failure to maintain audit trails or proper documentation of access rights.  
* Breach of organisational policies linked to least privilege principles.

#### Financial Risks

* Excessive resource utilisation or mismanagement leading to inflated costs.  
* Risk of unauthorised resource consumption, resulting in unexpected billing increases.  
* Additional costs from incident response, remediation actions, and legal penalties following security breaches.


### Recommended Security Practices

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant permissions only as necessary for specific tasks.  
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Use roles to define permissions aligned with job responsibilities.  
* **Regular Review:** Conduct periodic audits of permissions and access logs.  
* **Training and Awareness:** Ensure all personnel with admin rights receive appropriate organisation-specific training.  
* **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive records of configurations, access rights, and changes.
