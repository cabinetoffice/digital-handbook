# Technical incident management guidance

## 

## 1\. Purpose

This guidance applies to digital platforms and services within Cabinet Office Digital.

It explains how to manage technical incidents. The goal is to restore normal service quickly with minimal impact on users and the department.

Technical incidents may also be cyber security or data loss incidents.

This guidance is for general technical incidents. You must still follow the separate, formal processes for:

* **Cyber Security Incidents:** Report immediately to the [Cabinet Office Cyber Security Team](https://intranet.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/it-data-and-security/cyber-and-information-security-services/#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20report%20a%20cyber%20security%20incident)  
* **Data Breaches:** Report immediately to the [Cabinet Office Data Privacy & Compliance Team](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclsR0TLuhIqbgxR0vFayMo4q4BKa_1ob_oVeYSRvPytQU6xw/viewform)

You must include these reporting requirements in your local service manual, guides, and processes.

## 2\. How to determine incident priority

You must classify all incidents using two factors: **impact** and **urgency**. This ensures a consistent response.

### **2.1. Define impact**

Impact is the effect of the incident on the department. When you assess impact, consider:

* **Scope:** How many staff are affected?  
* **Business Function:** What business function is blocked?  
* **Seniority:** Are SCS, Ministers, or their Private Offices affected?  
* **Data:** Is sensitive business data inaccessible, incorrect, or at risk?

### **2.2. Define urgency**

Urgency is how quickly the incident needs to be resolved. When you assess urgency, consider:

* **Time-Sensitivity:** Is there an imminent, immovable deadline?  
* **Workaround:** Is there an easy, temporary workaround for staff?  
* **Rate of Degradation:** Is the problem getting worse?

**2.3. The priority matrix**

Use the impact and urgency matrix to set a priority level (P1 to P6). This makes classification consistent.

**Example service impact matrix**

|  | High Urgency | Medium Urgency | Low Urgency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **High Impact** | P1 | P1 | P2 |
| **Medium Impact** | P2 | P3 | P4 |
| **Low Impact** | P3 | P4 | P5 |

## **3\. Incident priority levels**

This table defines the priority levels (P1 to P6) for internal services (In hour).

| Priority Level | Definition (Internal Context) | Expected Response | Expected Resolution Target |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **P1 (Critical)** | Critical business service outage (for example, all-staff network, email, or SSO is down). Ongoing unauthorised access (Cyber incident). | 20 minutes | Within 1 hour |
| **P2 (Major)** | Substantial degradation of a critical service (for example, email is unusable for everyone). Complete outage of a non-critical but important business service. | Within 1 hour | 4-8 hours |
| **P3 (Significant)** | Intermittent issues with a key service. Full outage for a small group of users or a single senior staff member (SCS+). | Within 2 hours | 1-2 business days |
| **P4 (Minor)** | Component failure with no immediate staff impact (for example, loss of a redundant server). A single user issue where a workaround exists. | Within 4 hours | 3-5 business days |
| **P5 (Monitor)** | Issue requiring no further action beyond monitoring. A cosmetic or low-impact bug is reported. | Within 1 business day | Log in backlog |
| **P6 (Informational)** | Request for information only (for example, "How do I connect to the printer?"). | Within 2 business days | Log in backlog |

## **4\. Support structure**

Service teams must define the roles and responsibilities (RACI) for incident management.

When defining these roles, you must explicitly resource a Service Delivery or Operations function. This function is responsible for the day-to-day running of the application and is distinct from the teams managing the underlying infrastructure or the product backlog.

### **Standard lines of support**

Cabinet Office incident management typically operates across 3 lines of support.

* **1st line (user support):** [Digital One Stop Shop](https://digital-one-stop-shop.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/support/catalog/items/160). This is the single point of contact for staff. They resolve basic issues and route other tickets to the correct 2nd line team.  
* **2nd line (technical support):** Live Services / Service Teams. They receive escalations from 1st line and automated alerts. They triage incidents using the matrix and are responsible for resolving P1 and P2 incidents.  
* **3rd line (product support):** The specialist 3rd line teams. They receive complex P3 and P4 incidents from 2nd line that need developer work. These incidents are managed as part of the team's backlog.

## 

## **5\. Incident management process**

### **5.1. P1 and P2 incident process (high priority)**

The Service Delivery (2nd line) team owns P1 and P2 incidents. A formal incident team manages them to ensure immediate resolution.

### **5.2. P3 and P4 incident process (low priority)**

2nd line support triages P3 and P4 incidents and assigns them to the 3rd line product team. The product team manages them as backlog items.

## **6\. P1 and P2 incident roles and activities**

### **6.1. Roles in the P1 and P2 incident team**

One person may perform multiple roles.

* **Incident lead (technical lead):** Manages the incident and coordinates the team. They analyse the incident, organise technical support, escalate to senior management if needed, and organise the post incident review. This is typically a Service Delivery role.  
* **Comms lead:** Coordinates with the incident lead to keep stakeholders informed. They update status pages and send communications.  
* **Technical support (service team):** Performs detailed analysis, diagnosis, and resolution. They engage 3rd line specialists if needed.  
* **Documenter:** Records all actions, decisions, and communications in the incident report with a clear timeline.  
  


### **6.2. P1 and P2 incident activities**

**1\. Create incident report and ticket** An incident is logged by a 2nd line team member (from an alert) or escalated from 1st line. They must create an Incident Report and log a [ticket in OneStop Shop](https://digital-one-stop-shop.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/support/catalog/items/160). The [Incident report template can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kb6-It-LMbj7UiO9bl2QCC5sCm0TW_3-dYfS10ov2ow/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p99426yo0rbv)

**2\. Prioritise the incident** Service Delivery must use the impact and urgency matrix (see section 2\) to assign a priority (P1 to P4).

**3\. Notify the incident lead** Service Delivery notifies the on-call incident lead for the affected service. On smaller teams, the Service Delivery engineer may act as the incident lead.

**4\. Assemble the incident team** The incident lead assembles the team (comms, technical support, documenter).

**5\. Investigate the incident** The incident lead performs the initial analysis. Technical support carries out a detailed investigation to find the cause, workarounds, and resolution options.

**6\. Document all actions** The documenter must keep a time-stamped log of all actions, discussions, and decisions in the incident report. This is essential for the post-incident review.

**7\. Communicate updates** The comms lead must provide regular updates as defined in the priority table (see section 3). You must:

* send all-staff communications via email (if the incident affects the whole department)  
* notify specific stakeholders

**8\. Resolve the incident** The incident is resolved when the incident lead agrees the service is restored. The incident lead updates the ticket with the root cause (if known) and details of the fix.

**9\. Close the incident (post incident review)** All P1 and P2 incidents must have a post incident review (PIR). You must use the review's output to complete the incident report and track actions to prevent the incident from happening again.
