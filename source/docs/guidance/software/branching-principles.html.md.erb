# Introduction

Git gives us flexibility in how we use version control to share and manage code. We should balance between this flexibility and the need to collaborate and share code in a consistent manner.

Team members publish, share, review, and iterate on code changes through Git branches shared with others. This branching strategy can ensure that we collaborate better and spend less time managing version control and more time developing code.

The principles, strategies, and policies detailed in this document provide a comprehensive framework for leveraging GitHub effectively. A well-defined approach to branching, commit hygiene, repository configurations, secure CI/CD practices, diligent code review processes, and clear release management are essential for achieving efficiency, maintaining high code quality, and ensuring security.

These guidelines are dynamic and should evolve with the software development landscape. Regular review and adaptation are essential to ensure these principles remain current with emerging best practices and continue to effectively support organisational objectives.
