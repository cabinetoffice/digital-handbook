# <%= current_page.data.title %>

To request a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) account for your service, use the [**Cabinet Office AWS Request Tool**](https://request-an-aws-account.platforms.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/).

The request tool details the specific form fields required, but you must ensure you have met the strict governance and technical prerequisites outlined below before applying.

##  Prerequisites and Approvals 

**Approvals**

* **Technical Design Authority (TDA) Approval**: Before starting development of a new service, you must ensure you have engaged with the [Cabinet Office Technical Design Authority](https://intranet.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/it-data-and-security/chief-technology-office/technical-governance-and-assurance/technical-design-authority/). You will be asked to provide evidence of this engagement.  
* **Financial Approval**: You must have approval from your business unit and the relevant Budget Holder.  
* **Cost Centre Code:** Have the correct Cabinet Office cost centre code ready for the recharge or invoice.

The request tool does not provide cost estimates. You are responsible for forecasting your costs using AWS pricing guidance to ensure affordability. AWS provides a [pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) that may be used. 

### **Information for the Request Form**

To complete the request, you will need:

* **Team Details:** Team name, shared email address, and team lead contact information.  
* **Service Details:** Service name and out-of-hours support requirements.  
* **Account Administrators:** Nominated users who comply with the AWS Administrator Policy.

### 

### **Team Capabilities**

* **Skills & Security:** You must possess the skills to operate and decommission services securely, in compliance with all Cabinet Office technical and security policies.  
* **Credential Management:** You must have a plan to manage credentials securely. This includes revoking access for leavers **on or before** their last day.

## **The Request Process**

1. Submit your request via the [AWS Request Tool](https://request-an-aws-account.platforms.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/).  
2. Your request is sent to the **Platform Engineering team** for a manual validity check.  
3. Once approved, the account is provisioned and handed over to you.

## **Account Ownership and Responsibilities**

**Important:** Once the account is provisioned, the **Service Owner** assumes full responsibility. The **Platform Engineering team** does not maintain, monitor, or manage the account.

* **Self-Service User Management:** You are responsible for adding and removing users. This is a purely self-service function managed via the [User Management Tool](https://request-an-aws-user.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/#manage-users%20)  
* **Security and Decommissioning:** You must manage credentials, enforce security policies, and decommission services when they are no longer needed.  
* **Leavers Process:** You must have secure plans for user management, including removing access for leavers **before** or **immediately after** their last day.  
* **Naming Conventions:** Account names should be descriptive and lower-case separated by dashes. It should follow the following standards:    
  Pattern 1:

          \[`service name`\]-\[`environment`\] 

(e.g., `public-appointment-production or  public-appointment-integration`).

Pattern 2: 

\[business unit\]-\[service name\]-\[environment\]

(e.g., `public-appointment-production or  public-appointment-integration`).
