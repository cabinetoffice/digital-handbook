The Cabinet Office Architecture Principles are a set of rules and guidelines that apply across the Cabinet Office. They exist to help projects and programmes realise the wider
technology-related objectives for the Cabinet Office, and hence enable and support the CO business goals. They should be used to guide project decision-making within relevant teams.

The purpose of these Architecture Principles is to consider the Cabinet Office as a whole, functioning business-value delivering Enterprise. Delivery activities represent the discrete step changes, both adding to and removing from the operational technology environment that we operate in Cabinet Office.

You should use these principles in conjunction with the other related Cabinet Office principles, policies and strategies in the areas of concern.  These include the Service Acceptance Principles and the Cabinet Office Hosting Principles and Strategies, Data Strategies and Technology Strategies which provide a more focused and detailed set of implementation guidance and governance for specific technology subsets or domains.

These principles are in alignment with the Technology Code of Practice, Government Design Principles, GOV.UK Service Manual, NCSC Cloud Security Principle and Cloud First Policy. They are intended to consider the Government-wide content and apply them to the context of the Cabinet Office.

## Using These principles

These architecture principles are general rules and guidelines and reflect a level of consensus across the enterprise and embody the spirit and thinking of those within and working with the enterprise architecture function.

The principles inform and represent the approach for digital and technology activities within the Cabinet Office such that the immediate project needs can be aligned with the longer-term vision and sustainable operations for the wider Cabinet Office. They reflect a level of consensus across the enterprise and embody the spirit and thinking of those within and working with the enterprise architecture function.

As part of technology seeking technology input, reviews, and assurance processes, we expect projects and programmes to be able to relate their plans and activities to these principles, and capture that knowledge for sharing across Cabinet Office.

## 1. Maximise the Cabinet Office business goals

We should make decisions that provide the greatest benefit to the entire enterprise. This means looking beyond the immediate project goals and considering the broader context and impact on the Cabinet Office (CO) of what has been developed and what has been replaced.

Technology investments should only be made if they clearly contribute to the business objectives of the CO and align with its long-term technology direction.

Your team should:
* Begin each project by understanding the business objectives, stakeholder requirements, contexts, and constraints.
* Ensure all projects have a business case with measurable outcomes aligned with the Cabinet Office's direction.
* Assign a person responsible for measuring, reporting, and realising the stated business benefits.

This approach ensures that all decisions and investments are strategically aligned with the overarching goals of the Cabinet Office, fostering a coherent and unified enterprise direction.

## 2. Apply risk-based proportionate governance and assurance
Governance measures should align with the scale, complexity, and risk of the project or activity. This ensures governance practices are effective and efficient, providing essential oversight and control without excessive or redundant procedures.

Establish a governance structure that incorporates checkpoints to guide the project in the right direction and manage risks. This framework should facilitate stakeholder engagement and feedback to ensure alignment and responsiveness to their needs.

Governance and assurance must strike a balance with other project requirements, including team dynamics, deliverability, and costs.

Additionally, use the governance structure to monitor and ensure alignment between dependencies, such as other projects that provide necessary functionality. Track resource, delivery, and operational alignment, and maintain convergence of goals and outcomes. This ensures a clear governance trail exists, enabling timely corrective actions when necessary.


## 3. Share, reuse and collaborate
We should seek to reuse elements from other projects, and share elements of your project with the other teams in the Cabinet Office and other government organisations. These elements include user research, design and technical components.

We can reduce risk, learn from each other and deliver projects quickly and efficiently by building on other projects and reusing components. We should collaborate to reduce duplication of effort.

We should maximise the reusability of the service and technical components, for example,
break down the software development into reusable components
use open standards to define interactions
share your work openly when appropriate
