The [Central Digital and Data Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office) (CDDO) provides a comprehensive framework for managing and modernizing legacy IT systems within public sector organisations. This guidance aims to address the challenges posed by outdated technology, ensuring that government services remain efficient, secure, and capable of meeting the evolving needs of citizens.

Legacy IT systems, often outdated and difficult to maintain, can hinder the delivery of effective public services. By following this guidance, we can assess the risks associated with legacy systems, prioritize modernization efforts, and implement best practices for managing these systems. The goal is to reduce technical debt, improve system performance, and enhance overall service delivery.
