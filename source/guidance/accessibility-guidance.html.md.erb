The Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) has published comprehensive accessibility guidance to ensure that public-facing digital services are inclusive and accessible to all users. This guidance is designed to help government agencies and departments meet the accessibility requirements for their websites and applications, making them usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.

By following this guidance, organizations can create digital services that are not only compliant with legal standards but also provide a better user experience for everyone. The guidance covers various aspects of accessibility, including designing accessible services, creating accessible content, and testing with assistive technologies.
