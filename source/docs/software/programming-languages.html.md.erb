The Cabinet Office uses a standardised set of programming languages for core software development tasks to enable:

* developers and engineers move between projects easily  
* develop shared components that can be reused by different projects  
* strength organisational capabilities  
* smooth transition between suppliers and in-house capabilities

## Prototyping

You should use [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/) and follow the guidance in [GOV.UK Design Systems](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to build the protoypes.

## Frontend development

### Client-side

You should follow the Service Manual [Service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement)’s guidance, and progressively build your site starting from HMTL, CSS or GOV.UK Frontend.

Whilst you may use JavaScript to add interactive elements to your service, you should follow the advice in [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement) and consider the alternative options to JavaScript, and understand how to develop a robust frontend with JavaScript.

### Server-side

You should use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for Server side scripting.

You should use Node.js to render a web interface for your service, for example, to created thin, client-facing applications that do not store data.

You may also use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to work with more complicated requirements, e.g. to working with a statically typed, compiled language,

## Backend development

You should use the core languages defined for backend development as follow:

* [Java](https://guidance.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/manuals/programming-languages/java.html)  
* [Python](https://guidance.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/manuals/programming-languages/python/python.html)  
* [Ruby](https://guidance.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/manuals/programming-languages/ruby.html)

Your can also use Node.js in the backend for serverless systems.

### Note on Python

You should write new Python projects in Python 3\. [Python 2 reached end of life in 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/). Python 3 is now well-supported by application frameworks and libraries, and is commonly used in production.

## Using other languages

There may be reasons to deviate from the standardised languages. For example:

* extending an existing codebase or framework  
* scripting in a particular operating environment  
* experimenting during an alpha (with an expectation that it’s replaced by something we have more confidence in for beta)  
* working in a very specific or unusual problem domain, like heavy use of WebSockets

If you want to use a non-standard language, you should seek approval from the [Techical Design Authority](https://guidance.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital-handbook/docs/governance/technical-design-authority.html).
